# Capstone-Project
My capstone ideas

1. Ghost Encyclopedia App - app with detailed ghost profiles, including strengths, weaknesses, and evidence required for identification as well as a way to identify them with less evidence.
   I feel this is a good choice because it will help me practice API Integration as well as full stack development in a fun way.
3. Gaming social media platform- Where users can add each other and start sidechats with one another as well as post clips.
   Will help with using APIS and social media functionality
   
5. Game Quiz app - Where its like a trivia for games with multiple choice answers.
   API Integration and full stack skills to a test.
